# Necesse-Translation-Community

***Unofficial translations***

Every language must have lang.localname and lang.engname to be loaded.      
*File must be saved with UTF-8 encoding.*

\<***text***> *will be replaced with some other text or value.*          
***"ยง"*** *following a number, letter or #hexcode means the following text will be formatted.*         
***"\n"*** *means go to next line.*             
***[item/input=...]*** *will be replaced by an icon of the item/control key.*          

With every game update, all included language files will be updated with missing translations.             
This means you can search for MISSING_TRANSLATION to find and add them.        

If a translation is the same as english, make sure to add "SAME_TRANSLATION:" before the translation key,         
similar to how it is before missing translation. It is also possible to force this update my clicking the language in game while holding down shift.
